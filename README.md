# GamePadTest
The project is built to show how to get Java and a game controller to work together. It is based on the jinput library. The GUI is built using javafx.

<p>In this project, I tried to expand the functionality of the library by adding the ability to connect and disconnect the controller at any time the program is running.
To test the functionality used a controller from xbox 360.
